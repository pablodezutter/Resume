        <h2>The Story of Me (in short):</h2>
        <p>A great deal of my life I worked with <span class="camomile">kids</span>. I started my career as a
          teacher. Not just a teacher, one for toddlers.Yeah, that one.
          I like it that the still can be <strong>amazed</strong> by stuff.
          And they are upfront, so you know what they want. </p>
          <p>I am also a big fan of nature. Especially trees. They remind me of the <span class="ginger">root of life</span>.
          They have great fundaments underground, they look strong and determined to be.
          <p>Ancient history can also move my feelings. If you would pick a period in history, what would it be?</p>
            <p>For me there is no doubt: Greek - Roman period. Myths, legends, magnificant sculptures, magical buildings.

          have, everyone has. Well, I am walking on
          earth for 38 years and in that time I've mastered:
