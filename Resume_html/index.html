        <h2>The Story of Me:</h2>
        <p>
          A great deal of my life I worked with <span class="camomile">kids</span>. I started my career as a
          teacher. Not just a teacher, one for toddlers. Yeah, that one. But
          after a year it became clear that
          <em>jobs are being fought for</em> and<br />
          <em>toddlers are no easy audience</em>. So, I moved on. I also really
          moved with my girlfriend in an rented apartment and found an other
          job. Daycare. Kids. Fun. Twothousandandfive.<br />
          ...[Five years later]...<br />Daycare. Kids. Crowded. Noise. So, back
          on the search as a teacher.<br> 
          It all took a turn when I began classes in the sales world as a commercial assistant. 
          Still didn't do the trick to get a proper job in sales. <br>
          Self-confidence is good and in sales you need lots of it. But that was a problem. 
          So I did call-agency. Cold calling, selling off products... After a year of hard work and coaching - they had so much patience! - 
          I realized:... I am not really a pure <span class="ginger">salesman</span>.

          But what am I then? 
          Always a hard subject to talk about. I've got skills. Off course, I
          have, everyone has. But what should I mention? Well, I am walking on
          earth for 38 years and in that time I've mastered:

            <td>Creating: as a kid, student and teacher. Materials: all sorts, even languages.</td>
            <td>Problem-solving: if I dig for a solution I like it to be long-lasting.</td>
            <td>Think: prefer to think out of the box, although I like been told what to do, I still like to think for myself.</td>
            <td>Diapering: yeah well, what can I say...</td>
