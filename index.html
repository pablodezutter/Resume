        <h2>The Story of Me (in short):</h2>
        <p>
          A great deal of my life I worked with
          <span class="camomile">kids</span>. I started my career as a teacher.
          Not just a teacher, one for toddlers.Yeah, that one. I also have two
          kids at home. The best I liked in working with kids, is that they
          still can be so insanely be <strong>amazed</strong> by stuff. And they
          are deliciously upfront, so you know what they want.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also a big fan of nature. Especially
          <span class="camomile">trees</span>. They remind me of the
          <span class="ginger">root of life</span>. They have great fundaments
          underground, they look strong and determined to be.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ancient history can also move my feelings. If you would pick a period
          in history, what would it be?
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, my answer has no doubt: Greek - Roman period. Myths,legends,
          magnificant sculptures, magical buildings.

          Always a hard subject to talk about. I've got skills. Off course, I
          have, everyone has. I just think my expertise is broad and I am eager
          to learn.
        </p>
        <p>These are skills I master the basics off:</p>

          Currently I live in the lovely city of Bruges. I am aware of my
          ecological footprint so I prefer alternative transportion ways but I
          am sure we can work that part out.
