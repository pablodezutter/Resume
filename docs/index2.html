          <h2>The Story of Me (in short):</h2>

          <p>
            A great deal of my life I worked with
            <span class="camomile">kids</span>. I started my career as a
            teacher. Not just a teacher, one for toddlers. As a former teacher
            and a parent, I believe the beauty of life is to watch and be
            insanely <strong>amazed</strong> by life. Just like kids. Kids are
            also deliciously upfront and that is a quality I like. Being
            upfront with respect. Respect the code, respect the beauty.

              I am also a big fan of nature. Especially
              <span class="camomile">trees</span>. They remind me of the
              <span class="ginger">root of life</span>. They have great
              fundaments underground, they look strong and are determined to be.
              In building websites, fundaments must also be strong, just like
              trees.

              Ancient history can also move my feelings. If you would pick a
              period in history, what would it be? For me, my answer is without
              doubt: Greek - Roman period. Myths,legends, magnificant
              sculptures, magical buildings.

              I love fiction. Fiction can open perspectives in a way. It is like dreams. Sometimes a good movie really
              makes you think.
              Loved the "Lord of the Rings" and movies, "Divergent". I guess I am a dreamer, but I can help making the
              world 'prettier' again.
              To be honest,I make to little time to read. I really liked reading the books of Tom Clancy. It's a while
              ago
              now, but I still look up to the character of Jack Ryan.

          "Experience, talent, skills". Always a hard subject to talk about. I've got
          <span class="ginger">skills</span>. Off course, I have, everyone
          has. But I like to be modest. I also like to keep it simple. I don't like to make my work hard to
          understand. <span class="camomile">Clean and simple. Basic.</span> That is how I like it. I think
          my expertise is broad and I love to strengthen my skills. <p>Motivation is a great <span
              class="ginger">fundament</span> for that.</p>

          Currently I live in the lovely city of Bruges. I am aware of my
          ecological footprint so I prefer alternative transportion ways but I
          am sure we can work that part out.
