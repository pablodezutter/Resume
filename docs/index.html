            <h2>The Story of Me (in short):</h2>

            <p>
              A great deal of my life I worked with
              <span class="camomile">kids</span>. I started my career as a
              teacher. Not just a teacher, one for toddlers. As a former teacher
              and a parent, the beauty of life is to watch and be insanely
              <strong>amazed</strong> by life. Just like kids. Kids are also
              deliciously upfront and that is a quality I like. Being upfront
              with respect. Respect the code, respect the beauty.

              I am also a big fan of nature. Especially
              <span class="camomile">trees</span>. They remind me of the
              <span class="ginger">root of life</span>. They have great
              fundaments underground, they look strong and determined to be. In
              building websites, fundaments must also be strong, just like
              trees.

              Ancient history can also move my feelings. If you would pick a
              period in history, what would it be? For me, my answer is without
              doubt: Greek - Roman period. Myths,legends, magnificant
              sculptures, magical buildings.

            Always a hard subject to talk about. I've got
            <span class="ginger">skills</span>. Off course, I have, everyone
            has. I like to keep it simple. I don't like to make my work hard to
            understand. Clean and simple. Basic. That is how I like it. I don't
            shout unless I have to. I just think my expertise is broad by
            experience and I am eager to learn.

            Currently I live in the lovely city of Bruges. I am aware of my
            ecological footprint so I prefer alternative transportion ways but I
            am sure we can work that part out.
